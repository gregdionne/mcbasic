# Circle Drawing Benchmark

The "circle" folder draws a circle on the TRS-80 MC-10 using three different methods.  It is compiled both with and without native instructions.  It demonstrates some of the limitations of fixed-point arithmetic.

# Sort Benchmark

The "sort" folder contains identical versions of the classic bubblesort and quicksort algorithms that may be run on a TRS80 MC-10.

# For-Loop Benchmark

The "forloop" folder contains a program that flashes a cursor using an empty for-loop as a delay routine.
